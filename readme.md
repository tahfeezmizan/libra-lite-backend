A simple and efficient **RESTful API** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to manage a library system. This system allows users to manage books and borrowing operations, with features like CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and aggregation of borrowed records.

## Features

- Add, view, update, and delete books
- Filter and sort books by genre, availability, or creation date
- Borrow books with due dates and quantity tracking
- Aggregation for borrowed book summaries (total quantity borrowed per book)
- Automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Error handling and HTTP status codes
